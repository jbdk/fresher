/*
Package config handles configuration of the app.

The config file is in yaml format for easy readability.
Create a default config file in the current working directory using the -init flag.

A config is handled one of three ways:
  - If a file exists at the path, it is attempted to be parsed as a valid config file.
  - If a file does not exists at the path, the built-in defaults are used after a
    warning is shown about the missing file.
  - If the path is blank, the default config is used.

This package must not import any other packages from within this repo to prevent
import loops (besides minor utility packages) since the config package is most likely
read by nearly all other packages in this repo.

When adding a new field to the config file:
  - Add the field to the File type below.
  - Determine any default value(s) for the field and set it in newDefaultConfig().
  - Set validation in validate().
  - Document the field as needed (README, other documentation).
