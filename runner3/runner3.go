/*
Package runner3 handles building and running the binary when a file has been modified.

How watching/building/running works:
  - The directory tree starting at the root working directory is walked (recursively).
  - If the directory is not ignored, per the config file settings, an fsnotify watcher
    is set on each directory to watch for changes to files within that directory.
  - When a file change event occurs, the file is checked to see if it has a watched
    extension. If yes, the binary is rebuilt and/or rerun as needed.
